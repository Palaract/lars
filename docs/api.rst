=============
API Reference
=============

The framework is designed in a modular fashion with a separate module for each
log input format, each data output format, a few auxilliary modules for the
datatypes exposed by the framework and their functionality. Where possible,
standards dictating formats are linked in the API reference.

Each module comes with documentation including examples of usage. The best way
to learn the framework is to peruse the API reference and try out the examples,
modifying them to suit your purposes.
