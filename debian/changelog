lars (1.0ubuntu1) xenial; urgency=medium

  * Permit NULL values in first row when creating SQL tables (but warn as this
    is not encouraged)
  * Permit sources and targets to be used outside of context handlers (makes
    experimentation in the REPL a bit nicer)
  * Don't warn when request is NULL in Apache log sources (in certain
    configurations this is common when stringent timeouts are set)
  * Fixed incorrect generation of Oracle multi-row INSERT statements
  * Fixed operation of SQL target when row doesn't cover complete set of
    target table rows
